@everyone
🚨 **Bobbies on the beat just got an upgrade!** 👮‍♂️👮‍♀️
<br>
🔹 **4 brand-new UK police vehicles** added – flashing lights, blaring sirens, and an unmistakable British presence!
🔹 **Authentic UK traffic lights** – because nothing says realism like waiting at a red in the pouring rain ☔🚦
<br>
🔧 **Massive shoutout** to Jacobmaate for the base models and most of the textures – their work is absolutely top-tier!

This update was built using Jacobmaate’s template, then reworked with custom textures to give everything that unique UK feel.

🇬🇧 Whether you're upholding the law or trying to dodge it... things just got a whole lot more British.
